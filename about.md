Matt Brown is CTO at Pattern89, the data science for paid social platform, 
where he leads a team of engineers who help marketers experiment at scale. 
In his past, he was Director of Engineering for both Salesforce and ExactTarget. 
Those positions came after the acquisition of iGoDigital where he was VP of Engineering. 
He has interests in many things including ruby, scones and good beverages 
(only ask about coffee if you have time to spare).  I'm currently roasting my own coffee 
on an [Aillio Bullet R1](https://aillio.com).  If you are interested in talking more about 
coffee or trying some, send me an email.

I have a long standing passion for public education and served a term on the 
Lawrence Township School Board from 2012 - 2016. More recently, I have developed
a love for overseas missions having been on several trips, most recently to Kenya and Rwanda
where I have been involved with [Village Project Africa](http://villageprojectafrica.org/)
and small business training in Rwanda.
